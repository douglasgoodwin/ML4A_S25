**Project Overview: Reimagining the Canon - Individual Analysis, Collaborative Manifesto** (25 points)

**Welcome to CLASS PROJECT 01!** In this project, we'll be engaging deeply with Walter Benjamin's influential essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." This isn't about passive reading; you'll be active critics and creators, exploring the relevance of this classic text for today's world. We will use AI as a critical tool, and together, we will build powerful arguments that will resonate beyond the classroom. Finally, we will share our work with the world through an online publication.

**Project Goals:**

*   **Critical Analysis:** Develop a deep understanding of Benjamin’s essay through close reading, AI-assisted analysis, and personal reflection. *You will each focus on a unique chapter* of the text, becoming an expert in that specific area.
*   **Contemporary Relevance:** Explore how Benjamin’s ideas resonate with current issues and identify areas that require updating or critique.
*  **Chapter Connection**: Learn to work with partners to connect ideas between adjacent chapters of the text.
*   **Creative Synthesis:** Extract the most powerful ideas from Benjamin's essay and repurpose them into your own creative work.
*   **Collaborative Creation:** Learn how to work effectively in a group to create a powerful, unified, and *titled* manifesto that addresses contemporary concerns.
*  **AI as a Tool**: Understand and evaluate the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) as part of your critical practice.
*   **Public Engagement:** Share your work with a wider audience by publishing your manifesto online.

**Project Structure:**

This project is structured into two main phases, and it will span over 2-3 weeks:

**Phase 1: Individual Analysis and Reflection (Week 1)**

In this phase, you'll work individually to deeply analyze and reflect upon *your assigned, unique chapter* of Benjamin's work. You will self-select a chapter from the provided Google Sheet. For this chapter, you will:

1.  **Initial Reading:** Start by reading your assigned chapter carefully and summarize its key ideas, themes, and initial questions.
2.  **LLM-Augmented Analysis and Critical Reflection:** Use a Large Language Model (like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude) to analyze your chapter. You'll document your prompts, the AI's output, and your critical evaluation of its analysis. Then, identify the most resonant, problematic, and potent ideas within your unique chapter.

**Phase 2: Collaborative Manifesto Creation & Publication (Week 2-3)**

In this phase, you’ll work in groups to transform your individual insights into a collective vision, culminating in a published manifesto. You will:

1.  **Partner Work:** You will work with the student who analyzed the chapter directly after yours, and brainstorm connections between those two parts of the text.
2.  **Group Synthesis:** Share your chapter analyses, partner-work connections, and reflections with your group. Identify the most powerful ideas across all chapters, and decide on 1-2 contemporary issues to address.
3.  **Manifesto Drafting:** Collaboratively draft a manifesto that addresses your chosen issue(s), directly referencing and adapting concepts from *multiple chapters* of Benjamin's essay. You will also use an LLM to critique your draft, and will document how you chose to respond to that feedback.
4.  **Publication:** Finalize your manifesto with a *compelling title*, and prepare it for online publication. We will be publishing our work on a Github site.
5.  **Presentation:** You will also be presenting your final manifesto during class time, to justify your choices.

**Key Elements of the Project:**

*   **Individual and Collaborative Work:** Combines independent exploration with group synthesis and creation.
*   **Deep Reading:** Close engagement with a canonical text that will challenge and reward you.
*  **Chapter Connection:** You will be learning how to put your own chapter into conversation with those that come before and after it.
*   **Critical Thinking:** You'll analyze the text, reflect on its meaning, and identify both its strengths and weaknesses.
*   **AI Engagement:** You'll use LLMs as tools to deepen your analysis, but also critically assess their usefulness and limitations.
*   **Creative Remixing:** You'll use the ideas from Benjamin's text to craft something new and relevant for today.
*   **Public Voice:** You’ll contribute to a public conversation through online publication.

**Why this Project Matters:**

This project is designed to help you become more active, critical, and confident readers, thinkers, and creators. You’ll learn how to use technology responsibly, engage with ideas from the past, translate those ideas into your own persuasive writing, and find the right platform to make your voice heard. By the end of this project, you will have produced a meaningful document that reflects your critical, creative, and collaborative abilities, and that will join a larger conversation through online publication.

**Assessment:**

Your work will be assessed based on:

*   The quality of your individual chapter analyses, as well as your partner work.
*   Your engagement with and critical assessment of LLMs.
*   The creativity, originality, and persuasiveness of your group manifesto.
*   The effectiveness of your group's response to LLM critique.
*   The clarity of your final presentation.
*   Demonstrated understanding of Benjamin’s text and the links between the ideas and your creative work.

We are excited to see what you create and to hear the conversations that you help to start. Let's begin!

**Key Changes:**

*   **Public Voice:** The overview now emphasizes the online publication of the manifesto as a central component.
*   **Clearer Structure:** More direct language to communicate the structure and the process.
*   **Emphasis on Connection:** A more direct language to emphasize the partnership work before the larger group work.
*   **Purposeful Language:** The language throughout is designed to help students understand why the project is important and to see themselves as active participants in intellectual discourse.
